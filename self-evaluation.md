# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
Feel pretty good after going through this lesson.  the practice examples in the lesson really helped me explore different methods.  The video also did a fantatic job of breaking down each method and how it works.  
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?  It was definitely a productive struggle. It took a little longer to finish than i expected but that's mainly because I was researching how to do some of the practice exercises.  The challenge that wanted us to print all strings starting with "P" took me the longest to figure out, but in the processess i learned how to combine each method with if statements.  It feels good to know this was more advanced but I feel comfortable with it after finishing this lesson. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I think continuing to look at coding challenges/practice like we had in the iteration lesson.  It helped me learn some new methods and how to combine things like if statements in the code block in between the each method.  

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Nothing I can think of at this time.  Most of the questions or issues I had pop up during this lesson I was able to find answer/solutions by doing google searches.
